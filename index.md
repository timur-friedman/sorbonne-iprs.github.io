Sorbonne IPRS is an initiative to continuously monitor IP-level routing across the internet.
This is done through the regular collection of `traceroute`-style measurements from multiple vantage points towards a significant portion of the internet's routable address blocks.
The survey is conducted by the [Dioptra](https://dioptra.io) research group at [Sorbonne University](https://sorbonne-universite.fr/en)'s [LIP6](https://www.lip6.fr/?LANG=en) computer science laboratory.

As of December 2024, IPRS provides:

* Four daily IPv4 snapshots featuring multipath route traces from ten vantage points, covering all routable IPv4 /24 prefixes
* One daily IPv6 snapshot with single-path route traces covering a substantial number of prefixes
