## Data Access and Citation

IPRS data is available through two primary channels:

### Measurement Lab

IPv4 snapshots are accessible via [Measurement Lab](https://www.measurementlab.net)'s Google BigQuery tables.
This data is provided in the `scamper1` format, consistent with existing Measurement Lab `traceroute` data.

### Dioptra

Contact the Dioptra group directly for your additional data needs:

* More detailed versions of the IPv4 data
* The IPv6 data

We can make this data available to you as ClickHouse tables, which are an Amazon S3-compatible format.
Other formats are also possible.

## Citation

Please cite this data as M-Lab's Sorbonne IPRS Data Set, <date range used>, or, if directly obtained from Dioptra, as The Sorbonne IPRS Data Set, <date range used>.
